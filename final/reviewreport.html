        For the "Every Picture" project, I received feedback from my TA, Abrar Syed who has extensive knowledge of web development and user-centered design, making their insights highly valuable. He provided actionable suggestions for addressing both functional issues and enhancing the user experience.

        Image Visibility Issue:
        The image was not appearing properly on the website because the container size was either too large or too small for the window. To resolve this, the TA recommended resizing the image container to ensure it fits within the viewport and remains visible.
        
        Slider Functionality:
        To improve user interaction, the TA suggested implementing a stop mechanism for the image slider. This would allow users to pause the slider and view an image closely without needing to click through the sequence manually.
        
        Centering the Image:
        They advised using the Flexbox layout technique to center the image within the window. This would make the design more polished and visually balanced.
        
        Enhancing Engagement with Audio:
        Adding a voice-over whenever a picture appears was another suggestion. This feature could make the project more engaging by providing an interactive, multimedia experience for users.
        
        These recommendations not only address the functional issues but also align with best practices, such as writing clean and reusable code. Incorporating these changes will improve both the technical and experiential aspects of the project.

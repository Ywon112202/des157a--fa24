    <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <p>
        Project Summary: I chose to update my Every Picture project to improve its functionality and design, creating a more intuitive and visually cohesive user experience.

        Project Description: For my Every Picture project, I plan to enhance functionality, design, and usability, with a strong focus on improving the overall user experience. To achieve this, I will implement a slider feature to display the remaining six photos, providing a seamless and interactive way for users to navigate through the gallery. Additionally, I aim to refine the modal window so that each photo is centered along with its description, ensuring a balanced and professional appearance. The modal will also dynamically adjust its size to match the dimensions of the displayed photo, creating a cleaner and more cohesive design. These improvements will not only enhance the visual appeal of the project but also make it more intuitive and enjoyable for users to engage with.

        Expert Feedback: I plan to seek feedback from TA Abrar Syed, focusing on the functionality of my project. I would ask him to identify any functionality issues, errors, or areas that need improvement and provide suggestions for fixing them.

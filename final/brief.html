                <p>
                    For my Every Picture project, I plan to enhance functionality, design, and usability, with a strong focus on improving the overall user experience. To achieve this, I will implement a slider feature to display the remaining six photos, providing a seamless and interactive way for users to navigate through the gallery. Additionally, I aim to refine the modal window so that each photo is centered along with its description, ensuring a balanced and professional appearance. The modal will also dynamically adjust its size to match the dimensions of the displayed photo, creating a cleaner and more cohesive design. These improvements will not only enhance the visual appeal of the project but also make it more intuitive and enjoyable for users to engage with.

                <p>
                    I plan to seek feedback from TA Abrar Syed, focusing on the functionality of my project. I would ask him to identify any functionality issues, errors, or areas that need improvement and provide suggestions for fixing them.

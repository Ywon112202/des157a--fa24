    <p>I am considering making several improvements to enhance the design and functionality of the website. First, I plan to adjust the size of the image container to ensure it fits properly within the viewport, as improper sizing can cause the image to appear incorrectly. To improve user interaction, I want to implement a stop mechanism for the image slider, allowing users to pause the sequence and closely view a specific image without needing to click through manually. Additionally, I aim to use the Flexbox layout technique to center the image within the window, creating a more polished and visually balanced design. </p>

                In this journal entry, I reflected on key takeaways from an article discussing best practices for form design. The article emphasizes creating user-friendly forms that are accessible, intuitive, and minimize user friction. Important points include clear labels, grouping related fields, and using validation to help users fix errors efficiently. These practices align with my own experiences using online forms, where simplicity and clarity make a significant difference in usability.

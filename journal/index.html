                In the article, forms are highlighted as critical elements in converting users on websites or mobile applications. The article emphasizes that creating a user-friendly, efficient form is a key responsibility of a product designer, as forms are essential to achieving conversions. Forms are portrayed as tools that, when designed correctly, reduce user frustration and improve completion rates, ultimately supporting business objectives. The article emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and clarity in form design to create an intuitive user experience that enhances conversions.

               I found out during joing LinkedIn and creating a profile can be somewhat challenging for users due to the multi-step process that takes place on separate pages. Unlike many other platforms that offer a more streamlined, on-page form for profile creation, LinkedIn requires users to navigate through different pages for each step. This can make the process feel less intuitive and more time-consuming. Additionally, users cannot edit their information immediately; they must visit their profile page or the job application form after completing the sign-up process. This separation can make it cumbersome to make quick updates or adjustments, as users may need to remember the information they initially provided and navigate back to the appropriate sections.
